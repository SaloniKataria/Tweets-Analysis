# Tweets-Analysis
Natural Language Processing, Sentimental Analysis, Word2vec, Tf-idf, Lemmatization 

In this python file, I have predicted the sentiment of tweets of Obama and Romney. THe following tasks have been achieved: 
- Wordclouds of positive and negative tweets
- Cleansing of the tweets 
- Lemmatization and Part of Speech 
- Word2Vec (Gensim) vectorisation 
- Bag of words generation 
- Term frequency inverse document frequency (Tf-Idf)

The main objective in the project was to compare the effectiveness of word2vec vs tfidf vectorisation. The following machine learning models were built using both kind of vectorisation for comparison: 
- Naive Bayes 
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine 
- k Nearest Neighbour 

Tf-Idf vectorisation based Random Forest was chosen with 62% and the prediction of sentiment output was executed.
